If you take a look at the pinned repositories, you'll find one called *buriOS*. If you open it and take a look at the commits, you'll see that the last next one is [*added this here by mistake lol*](https://github.com/Mayhul-Jindal/buriOS/commit/4d6492a87256049955d71c5ca9b19f71bb4e2f1d); open it and you'll find an image of what looks to be the screenshot of a CCTV camera situated in the [Nishiki Market](https://goo.gl/maps/GXyUcQiySicHFaBh7), a famous market in Kyoto, Japan.

So I searched on Google for open CCTV cameras that are in the Nishiki Market and I found [this website](https://www.webcamtaxi.com/en/japan/kyoto-prefecture/nishiki-market-cam.html) that has a [map with the exact location of the webcam](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.005028,135.764917,17z/).
I zoomed in and I found the [intersection](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.0050115,135.7649005,21z) (Tominokoji-dori - Nishikikoji-dori) where the camera is. Then, I used Street View to see on which side the camera is.

After obtaining this information, I immediately opened [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) and searched for the address *6048055, Higashiuoyacho, Nakagyo, Kyoto, JPN*. Then, I found a network called *GlocalNet_0UTSJD* in the same spot. **The flag is the network's BSSID.**
