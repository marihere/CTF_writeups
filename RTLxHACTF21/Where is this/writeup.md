We are given this image but we can’t read the signs because of the quality.

So I’ve edited the image so that I could read at least one of them and this is what I got:

We can read “Zum Padd” but then we can’t read the rest clearly.

But that’s okay… I searched for “Zum Padd” on Google Maps, I clicked the first result that came up (*which is Zum Paddenwirt, Nikolaikirchplatz 6, 10178 Berlin, Germany*), I used Street View and I found the same place but the coordinates weren’t correct.


After looking around for a while I found out that I had to click on the parking lot.
